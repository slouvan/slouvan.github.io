I am an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa AI, Cambridge, UK. Before joining Amazon, I earned my PhD from the [University of Trento](https://ict.unitn.it/). 
During my PhD, I was also affiliated with the [NLP Research Unit](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/nlp/) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) working with [Bernardo Magnini](https://ict.fbk.eu/people/detail/bernardo-magnini/). 
For my PhD, I worked on transfer learning and data augmentation for low resource Natural Language Understanding tasks for task-oriented dialogue systems.
